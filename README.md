# PCRaster
Environmental modelling software

PCRaster is a collection of tools and software libraries tailored to the construction of spatio-temporal environmental models. Application domains are amongst others hydrology (rainfall-runoff, global water balance, groundwater (with Modflow)), ecology, or land use change. Two scripting languages (Python and PCRcalc) include a rich set of spatial operations for manipulating and analysing raster maps. A Python framework supports Monte Carlo simulations and data assimilation (Ensemble Kalman Filter and Particle Filter). The Aguila tool allows for the interactive visualisation of stochastic spatio-temporal data.

You can find more information about our research and development projects on [our website!](http://pcraster.geo.uu.nl/) Documentation can be found [here](http://pcraster.geo.uu.nl/support/documentation/), for questions regarding the usage of PCRaster please use our [mailing list](https://lists.geo.uu.nl/mailman/listinfo/pcraster-info). A [compiled package](http://pcraster.geo.uu.nl/downloads/latest-release/) is available for Windows systems.

Note: we migrated multi-repository SourceForge-hosted sub-projects into this single GitHub-hosted project.
